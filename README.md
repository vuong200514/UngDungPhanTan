## What is it?

PupDB is an ernest attempt to create a simple file-based key-value database written in Python.

## Why PupDB?

The objective behind the creation of PupDB is to create a database system which performs simple persistence operations well and data can be accessed with a minimalist, easy-to-use API with least configuration.

### PupDB is the best choice when:

1. You need a simple NoSQL data store with an interface as simple as a Python `dict`, and want to start storing and retrieving data within a few minutes.
2. You want to create an application without bothering much about configuration and setup for storing data.
3. Your database is not very huge i.e. not greater than a few megabytes of data.

### When not to use PupDB:

1. You want to perform advanced queries on your data.
2. Your database is larger than a few megabytes of data.
3. You want a database software that supports advanced capabilities like indexing, partitioning etc.

## Salient Features

1. **Multi-processing support**: Same database file can be used across multiple processes concurrently.
2. **Mult-threading support**: Same database file (with separate `PupDB` instance per thread) can be used concurrently.
3. **REST-based HTTP Interface**: Apart from using it as a `python` package, you can also use PupDB via a `flask`-based HTTP interface. This way you can use PupDB with programming languages other than Python.

## Installation

PupDB can be installed using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pupdb
```

## Basic API Documentation and Usage

PupDB can be instantiated as follows:
```python
from pupdb.core import PupDB

# Specify database file path as an argument to the PupDB constructor. That's it.
db = PupDB('db.json')
```

1. `set(key, value)`: Stores the `value` mapped to `key` in the database file.
```python
db.set('test_key', 'test_value')
```
2. `get(key)`: Returns the `value` mapped to `key` in the database file. Returns `None` if `key` is not found.
```python
db.get('test_key')
```
3. `remove(key)`: Removes the `key` from the database file. Raises a `KeyError` if `key` is not found in the database file.
```python
# Remove the key `test_key` from the db.
db.remove('test_key')

# Try doing the same again and it'll raise a `KeyError`,
# as the key has already been deleted from the db in the above step.
db.remove('test_key')
```
4. `keys()`: Returns the keys present in the database file. Return type is `list` in Python 2 and [Dictionary view object](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=keys#dict-views) (similar to [`dict.keys()`](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=keys#dict.keys)) in Python 3.
```python
# Python 2
print db.keys() # This will print ['key1', ...]

# Python 3
print(list(db.keys())) # This will print ['key1', ...]
```
5. `values()`: Returns the values of all keys present in the database file. Return type is `list` for Python 2 and [Dictionary view object](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=keys#dict-views) (similar to [`dict.values()`](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=keys#dict.values)) in Python 3.
```python
# Python 2
print db.values() # This will print ['value1', ...]

# Python 3
print(list(db.values())) # This will print ['value1', ...]
```
6. `items()`: Returns the values of all keys present in the database file. Return type is `list` for Python 2 and [Dictionary view object](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=keys#dict-views) (similar to [`dict.items()`](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=keys#dict.items)) in Python 3.
```python
# Python 2
print db.items() # This will print [('key1', 'value1'), ...]

# Python 3
print(list(db.items())) # This will print [('key1', 'value1'), ...]
```
7. `dumps()`: Returns a `json` dump of the entire database file sorted by key.
```python
db.dumps() # This will print the database json string.
```
8. `truncate_db()`: Removes all data from the database file i.e. truncates the database file.
```python
db.truncate_db()
print(db) # Will print an empty database dict '{}', as the database has been truncated.
```

## Using the PupDB HTTP/REST Interface

**Using the HTTP/REST Interface, all PupDB-related operations can be performed without using PupDB as a Python package. As a result, PupDB can be used in any programming language that can make HTTP requests.**

To start PupDB's `gunicorn`-based `flask` server:

```python
from pupdb.server import start_http_server

# Start the gunicorn server (with 4 worker threads).
start_http_server()
```

The server will listen to local port 4000. The server will be available at `http://localhost:4000`.

### HTTP API Endpoints

1. `/get?key=<key-goes-here>` (Method: `GET`): This API endpoint is an interface to PupDB's `get()` method. e.g.:

```bash
curl -XGET http://localhost:4000/get?key=test
```

The above `curl` request will fetch the result for key `test`.

2. `/set` (Method: `POST`): This API endpoint is an interface to PupDB's `set()` method. e.g.:

```bash
curl -XPOST http://localhost:4000/set -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"key": "test", "value": "1234"}'
```

The above `curl` request will set the value `1234` to key `test` in the database.

3. `/remove/<key-goes-here>` (Method: `DELETE`): This API endpoint is an interface to PupDB's `remove()` method. e.g.:

```bash
curl -XDELETE http://localhost:4000/remove/test
```

The above `curl` request will remove the key `test` in the database. It returns a `404 Not Found` if the key does not exist in the database.

4. `/keys` (Method: `GET`): This API endpoint is an interface to PupDB's `keys()` method. e.g.:

```bash
curl -XGET http://localhost:4000/keys
```

The above `curl` request will return a payload containing the `list` of keys in the database.

5. `/values` (Method: `GET`): This API endpoint is an interface to PupDB's `values()` method. e.g.:

```bash
curl -XGET http://localhost:4000/values
```

The above `curl` request will return a payload containing the `list` of values of all keys in the database.

6. `/items` (Method: `GET`): This API endpoint is an interface to PupDB's `items()` method. e.g.:

```bash
curl -XGET http://localhost:4000/items
```

The above `curl` request will return a payload containing the `list` of `[key, value]` pairs in the database.

7. `/dumps` (Method: `GET`): This API endpoint is an interface to PupDB's `dumps()` method. e.g.:

```bash
curl -XGET http://localhost:4000/dumps
```

The above `curl` request will return a payload containing the string dump of the entire database.

7. `/truncate-db` (Method: `POST`): This API endpoint is an interface to PupDB's `truncate_db()` method. e.g.:

```bash
curl -XPOST http://localhost:4000/truncate-db
```

The above `curl` request will truncate i.e. remove all key-value pairs from the database.
